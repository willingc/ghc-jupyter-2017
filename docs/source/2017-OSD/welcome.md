# [Welcome to Jupyter and Open Source Day](https://ghc_jupyter.readthedocs.io)

Thanks for joining us today.

Key things for a successful Open Source Day:

- Have fun.
- Learn.
- Ask questions. *Pro tip: Great developers ask lots of questions.*
- Build useful things for humanity.

## Before the event

The Grace Hopper Celebration is a busy, vibrant event. We know you are busy. Since conference wifi
can be spotty, please setup your laptop (if possible) before Open Source Day.

- Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
- Install a favorite code editor (see recommendations in set up if you don't have a favorite)
- Create a GitHub account
- Install git
