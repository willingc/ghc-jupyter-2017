Conference wifi can be spotty at times. If you are able to install
these items before Open Source Day, that would be great. If you are not
able we'll have a way for you to do so at the event.

## Editor

You will need to have a code editor installed on your system. There are
many available that are open source. Two user friendly editors are:

- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## GitHub and git

[GitHub Help pages](https://help.github.com)

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
   if you do not already have one.

2. Make sure git is installed on your system.
3. From the command line (terminal), enter `git --version`. If git is
   installed on your system and its PATH, it will display git's version.
   
   
## Command line (Terminal)




## Jupyter Notebook

1. Download the [Anaconda installer](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
   for your operating system. FYI...most modern computers are 64 bit.

2. Run the installer.

3. Download the [conda cheatsheet](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)
